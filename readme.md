# Air Quality Network Sensor

## Urbanova

Source code and documentation for an experimental air quality sensor node based
on the Raspberry Pi series and low-cost retail sensors. Measurements are made 
every 10 seconds and recorded to local storage in tab-separated (TSV) files. 
Data are also exported to temporary files for integration with 
[RPi Monitor](https://rpi-experiences.blogspot.com) and `scp`-based scraping 
tools (e.g. the [Itron](https://www.itron.com/na/) Cloud service agent). 

This project is currently being adapted to support multiple platforms, with 
multiple sensor configurations:

### Documentation

* [Assembly notes](doc/hardware.md)
* [Initial setup](doc/software.md)
* [Integration with Itron Cloud](doc/itron.md)

Also, a relevant excerpt from optical particle counter user manual:

> "The accepted international standard definitions of particle mass loadings in
> the air are PM1, PM2.5 and PM10.  These definitions relate to the mass and 
> size of particles that would be inhaled by a typical adult. So, for example,
> PM2.5 is defined as ‘particles which pass through a size-selective inlet with
> a 50% efficiency cut-off at 2.5 μm aerodynamic diameter’.  The 50% cut-off 
> indicates that a proportion of particles of larger than 2.5 μm will be 
> included in PM2.5, the proportion decreasing withincreasing particle size, in
> this case out to approximately 10 μm particles."

### Testing

A few test data sets are available [here](testing/). You can view example code
in the Jupyter notebook "[Validation Testing](testing/Validation%20Testing.ipynb)" 
directly in Github, or to see/interact with the Bokeh plots too, open locally
with Jupyter or [render it](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/wsular/urbanova-aqnet-rpi-node/blob/master/testing/Validation%20Testing.ipynb)
using nbviewer.jupyter.org. 

* Bench test (Dec 4-5, 2016)
* Roof test #1 (Dec 5-6, 2016)
* Roof test #2 (Dec 14, 2016 - Jan 9, 2017)
